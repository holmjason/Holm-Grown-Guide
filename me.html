      <h3>Equipment</h3>
        <p>Supplied Equipment:<p>
        <p>Using a 2005 Skeeter TZD-200 with a 200 Yamaha. But keep your eyes peeled as I pick up the new beauty, a 2025 Skeeter ZXR-21 with a 250 Yamaha.</p>
        <p>The Skeeter is outfitted with a Garmin front facing sonar so we can find those schools of fish.</p>
        <p>You will be supplied rods, reels, and tackle. Most of the rods and reels are Sixgill fishing products.</p>
        <p>If you want to catch and keep your fish, running livewells will keep them fresh until our return to shore. Sorry, at this time, fish cleaning is not part of any offered package.</p>
        <p>All safety equipment as required by the State of Minnesota<p>
        <p>Holm Grown Guide Service reserves the right to end any guided trip without expectation of refund for safety reasons. Ie- severe weather, intoxicated guests, serious equipment malfunctions, etc. <p>

    <h3>My Mission</h3>
      <p>Most important is for you to enjoy your day on the water.</p>
      <p>My hope is to get you "catching" and not just "casting".</p>
      <p>Ask questions, with thirty years experience I have learned a thing or two and even now am continously learning more from everyone I meet. </p>
      <p>I'm here to guide you to the best fishing experience I can.</p>

  <div class="col-6 p-4">
    <h3>My Background</h3>
      <p>I have been fishing since I was a young tot and absolutely fell in love with spending time on the shores, on the docks, and on Grandpa's ol' bass boat in Minnesota's beautiful waters</p>
      <p>I started by taking my family and friends out and found a passion putting them on fish.</p>
      <p>I joined several fishing leagues in 2020 and have started fishing more semi-professionally since then, creating a name for myself and starting a social media presence that earned me sponsors like BillyRub Plastics and Bait, Sixgill Fishing Products and Buffalo Pizza.</p>
      <p>I currently help run a fishing league and finished in 3rd place overall in 2024 out of thirteen competing teams.</p>
      <p>I just started Holm Grown Guide Service in February 2025 and can't wait to meet you and make more friends with the same passion for anything fishing, from competitive tourneys to a relaxing day casting a line in to the water!</p>
