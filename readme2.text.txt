I used my website for my business as my base and jsut improved on it with bootstrap.
As you can see from my previous assignment i have made a lot of changes to the webpage.
Couple of key notes is that the email form will actuially send the message to my  personal email.
    Also added google calendar off my actual google calendar.
I had a fun time trying to figure out the carousel and making it change its image
    With that being said it will not let me do height: 50%; or any percentage and will only let me do px.
    I am not currently happy with that, but it works.  I have tried making it a class id and changing it that way and even put it
        in the class code on the html file, but will not allow percentage.
I just did a quick and easy card on my about me page with me and my boat for 2 different cards.
The carousel is on the contact page with four pictures.
I used the accordion for my sponsors on the about me page at the bottom.
Struggle:
    I struggled with the carousel and actaully asked for help with sizing.
    Took me a while to figure out the carousel css style to change a couple things on it.

Liked
    I liked how bootstrap has made the page look and more appealing.
    Like the carousel and will plan on using it more often in the page ie for the videos.

Java Script
    I plan on using java script to validate the email from location to make sure its an actual email with
        @ and a .
    I also want to use java to say hello when y ou join the page and when u click on certain things.
    I want to keep a page for reviews about my company on a page 4 just for reviews using java feedback storage.
    Plan on using java to also get totals for people who want different packages and a way to show them the total cost.

Overview
    I really like bootstrap and how it helped foramt my webpage and cant wait to implement java script to make my web page even 
        better.
